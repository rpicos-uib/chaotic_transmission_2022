# chaotic_transmission_2022
Implementation of a chaotic encryption schema using a digital chaotic oscillator. The code is an implementation of the procedure described in our paper (in review), so please cite it if (when :D ) you use it.

Currently it is set to transmit a fragment of "El Quijote", but it can be adapted to other things...
